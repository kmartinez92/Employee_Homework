Been working on the project lately haven't had time to catch up on the homework but I wanted to submit a psuedocode at least for it. 

- I'd create a database for the app that will store the employee information. 
- I'd create a schema for it requiring the following information
        id, name, title and salary

- Once I do that i'll createa  server.js page. Require express and mysql packages to the website. 
- I'd then create a models folder along with a public that will hold my html which i'll make accessible to the entire app. 
- i'll npm init and create a pacakage.json with the required dependencies.
